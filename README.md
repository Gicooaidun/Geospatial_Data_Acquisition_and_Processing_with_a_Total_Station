The project focuses on the manual operation of a Leica TS60 total station and executing repeated point measurements. We develop a Python script for measurement data conversion and processing. It implements a simplified test procedure for horizontal directions as specified in ISO 17123-3. For more detailed instructions and documentation, please refer to the accompanying PDF: Documentation.pdf.

## [2_Automatic_Measurement_with_a_Total_Station_via_GeoCOM](./2_Automatic_Measurement_with_a_Total_Station_via_GeoCOM/)
This software is designed to automate the operations of a Leica TS60 total station, allowing users to configure the total station settings directly from a computer. It is capable of autonomously measuring sets of points (angles, distances), provided that the total station is manually aligned to the required points during phase 1 of the initial setup. The software also analyzes these measurements according to the ISO 17123-3 standard, which specifies a simplified test procedure for horizontal directions. For more detailed instructions and documentation, please refer to the accompanying PDF: Documentation.pdf.

## [3_Assessing_Meteorological_Effects_on_Vertical_Coordinates_with_a_Total_Station](./3_Assessing_Meteorological_Effects_on_Vertical_Coordinates_with_a_Total_Station/)
Geodetic measurements, crucial for precise monitoring, are often influenced by atmospheric conditions, a factor that is sometimes overlooked or underestimated. In this project, we explore how various meteorological factors impact slope distance measurements taken with a total station. By examining these relationships, we aim to better understand and counteract the atmospheric effects on geodetic practices. We also analyze the manufacturer's distance correction model, which considers several meteorological parameters. This analysis will reveal the extent to which certain impacts can be reduced and what residual effects persist. Furthermore, we apply various atmospheric corrections and evaluate the use of either high-end or low-end meteorological sensors for different atmospheric parameters.
