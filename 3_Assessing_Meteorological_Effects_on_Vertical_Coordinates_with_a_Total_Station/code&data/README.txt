In order to run the meteo.py script, the path needs to be set to the correct directory. If the Data folder is in the same directory as the script, the PATH variable at the beginning of the script can be set to an empty string. Additionally, two new folders need to be created in the Data folder, where the original and corrected data are saved. In this case these two folders are called Original_data and Corrected_data. The meteo_analysis.ipynb file then loads the results from the meteo.py file and plots them. An additional folder outside the Data folder called Measurements needs to be created and all the measurements should be saved there. This can be adjusted using the FILE_PATH variable at the beginning of the data_analysis.ipynb script. The data_analysis.ipynb file then completes the remaining tasks. The files should thus be run in the following order: meteo.py -> meteo_analysis.ipynb -> data_analysis.ipynb
